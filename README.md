 Documents Capture Application

Overview
Documents Capture Application is a simple web-based CRUD system designed to help users add, edit, delete, and review document-related records 
The application simulates a small document-tracking system where you can enter client details, number of pages, costs, and automatically calculate net profit.  

It is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript and relies on LocalStorage for data persistence â€” meaning all records are saved locally in the browser.
