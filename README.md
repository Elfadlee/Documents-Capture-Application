 Documents Capture Application

Overview
Documents Capture Application is a simple web-based CRUD system designed to help users add, edit, delete, and review document-related records 
The application simulates a small document-tracking system where you can enter client details, number of pages, costs, and automatically calculate net profit.  

It is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript and relies on LocalStorage for data persistence — meaning all records are saved locally in the browser.

- Edit Records: Update existing entries through a dedicated update page.  
- Delete Records: Remove unwanted entries from the table.  
- Search: Quickly filter results using the search bar.  
- eports Page: Summarize profit and order details.  
- LocalStorage Persistence: All data is stored in the browser for convenience.  
- Auto Row Numbering: Rows are automatically renumbered when records are added or deleted.  



Technologies Used
- HTML5
